If you want to contribute just make your pull request 
with a description of the problem solved and the explanation
of the reasons of the implementation inside the docs/contribute folder.

Just create a Markdown file with your github userid. To give an example
i would create a docs/contribute/kendarorg.md file with all the
explanations!

Please-please add unit tests when possible! If it's getting too hard we
can open an issue and refactor!

Feel free!
