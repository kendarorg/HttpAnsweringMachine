The system support the addition of java plugins. 

You can get a basic pom for a plugin [here](java/pom.xml). All the important staff are marked
with the "CHANGEME" string. You'll event notice the "copy-jar-dependencies-to-target" task:
this is used to copy the needed dependencies near the target so that the main application
loader can use them.

The "copy-dependencies" task is the one that writes all "real" dependencies on the
"target/classes/lib" directory from which the "copy-jar-dependencies-to-target" will
take the data and where you could find the real dependencies.

<u>**IMPORTANT**

You should copy all dependencies, even the tranisitive ones, in the example pom is 
even included the "asm-5.0.4.jar" that was not identified as a direct dependency. Do
some run to check what is needed</u>

The jar and the dependencies should be placed into the [libs directory](../basic.md)
